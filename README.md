# Task Management System

## Objective
Create a task management system that uses Java collections, handles exceptions, processes dates with LocalDate, and uses streams for data filtering and transformation.

## Problem
Write a Java program that:

- Defines a Task class with fields for task description, due date, and priority (from 0 to 5).
- Manages a collection of tasks.

- Handles potential exceptions, such as invalid date formats.
- Filters and sorts tasks using streams based on the due date and priority.

- Prints tasks that are due today or overdue.

## Steps

- Define the Task class with appropriate fields and methods.
- Create a class to manage the collection of tasks.

- Implement methods to add tasks, handle exceptions, and process tasks using streams.
- Filter and sort tasks based on the due date and priority.

- Print tasks that are due today or overdue.

## Extra
- Added a system to generate random tasks in future and in past to create test cases
